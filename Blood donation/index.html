        <p><b>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made<br>
           into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components).<br>
            Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often<br>
            participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.<br>

            Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community <br>
            supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or<br>
            friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate for several reasons, such as a form of<br>
            charity, general awareness regarding the demand for blood, increased confidence in oneself, helping a<br>
            personal friend or relative, and social pressure. Despite the many reasons that people donate, not<br>
            enough potential donors actively donate. However, this is reversed during disasters when blood donations<br>
            increase, often creating an excess supply that will have to be later discarded. In countries that<br>
             allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money<br>
              such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use<br>
               (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle<br>
                is inserted or may feel faint.</p></b></div>

        We get it; blood can make you squeamish, you can't find the time during your busy working week to donate,<br>
         or you haven't got enough motivation to donate.<br><br>

However, despite all the reasons against blood donation, Australia faces a shortage of blood supply, which could<br>
severely affect us all in the near future.<br><br>

World Blood Donor Day takes place on 14 June each year. It is the voluntary and unpaid blood donors that make a critical<br>
 contribution to national health systems.<br><br>

Only one in thirty Australians will donate blood in their lifetime, which is only 3 percent of the population<br>
In contrast, one in THREE will need blood at some stage in their life<br>
Those who are most common to donate blood are those who have already been “touched by the need for blood”<br>
As the need for blood supply is on a steady rise, it has never been more important to donate! <br><br>

So now, how do you tackle the issue of finding enough time to donate?<br>

Organising a blood drive for your organisation is a great idea not only to save lives but to improve employee morale by creating a sense of unity, team pride and leadership.<br><br>

      <p><b>Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body, and carries carbon dioxide and other
         waste products back to the lungs, kidneys and liver for disposal. It fights against infection and
          helps heal wounds, so we can stay healthy. There's no substitute for blood. If people lose blood
           from surgery or injury or if their bodies can't produce enough, there is only one place to turn
            - volunteer blood donors.<br><br>

        In rich countries, when patients need blood it is usually available and safe for transfusion.
         In economically challenged countries, blood banks are often empty and what blood is available
          may put transfused patients at risk of contracting HIV or numerous other infections.<br><br>
          Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely
           access to safe blood. Providing safe and adequate blood should be an integral part of every country's
            national health care policy and infrastructure.WHO recommends that all activities related to blood
             collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution be coordinated at the national level through
              effective organization and integrated blood supply networks. The national blood system should be
               governed by national blood policy and legislative framework to promote uniform implementation of
                standards and consistency in the quality and safety of blood and blood products.<br><br>
          
          In 2018, 73 % of reporting countries, or 125 out of 171, had a national blood policy. Overall, 66% of
           reporting countries, or 113 out of 171, have specific legislation covering the safety and quality
            of blood transfusion, including:<br><br>
          
          79% of high-income countries<br>
          63% of middle-income countries<br>
          39% of low-income countries.<br></b></p>
